## About the project


"What's in my Drink?" is a website tailored to someone who is a frequent enjoyer and mixer of cocktails in all shapes and sizes. This website will provide the user with an easy to navigate encyclopedia of a wide variety of cocktails; the user will be able to search for a specific drink, look up drinks by category, get 10 random drinks at a time if they're feeling adventurous, or check out the most popular dinks if they're unsure what they want. Once the user has found themselves on a page of drinks they'd be interested in, each card contains a picture of what the finished product will look like, and the name of the drink. Once the user clicks on the drink, it displays information about the drink like what ingredients you'll need and their quantity, instructions on how to make the beverage, and the drink's nutritional information. 

## Tech Stack

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* TheCocktailDB (API)
* Edamam Nutritonal Analysis API

## Minimum Viable Product

The minimum viable product for this project was a web page that displays cocktails, then lists their measurements, ingredients, and calories when clicked on that can be used on mobile devices, and uses multiple API's. 

## Stretch Goals Complteted

* Search function that allows you to find specific drinks
* Random Drinks page that allows you to view 10 random drinks at a time
* Search By Ingredient page that displays every drink that contains a specific Ingredient

## Stretch Goals To Be Completed

* Allow the search by ingredient page to hold multiple ingredient queries at once
* Display more nutritonal information than just the caloric content for each drink such as macros, sugar content, vitamins etc.
